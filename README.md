# vadnu

What now? A repo for supporting and documenting the personal knowledge management system for [@hjdivad](https://github.com/hjdivad) and [@rwjblue](https://github.com/rwjblue).

We both use this system for project tracking, keeping track of relationships, tracking references and details, &c.

## Why "vad nu?"?

"Vad nu?" means "what now?" in Swedish. David (@hjdivad), who speaks Swedish, came up with the name. The name is essentially the purpose of our knowledge management system: organizing information to determine what to do next.
