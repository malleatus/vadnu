# Usage

## Navigation with Marks

Vadnu uses a system of marks for quick navigation:

#### Global Marks

- `A` - Set inside the H1 for the `TODO.md`
- `B` - Set inside the H3 for the current week
- `C` - Set on the line for feedbacks

#### Local Marks

- Project documents use `c` to mark the `## Log` section
- `TODO.md` uses `b` to mark the end of TODOs
- `a` and `b` are reserved as temporary local marks in projects
