# What is Vadnu?

Vadnu is a personal knowledge management (PKM) system created by [@hjdivad](https://github.com/hjdivad) and [@rwjblue](https://github.com/rwjblue) to organize information and determine what to do next.

## Why "Vadnu"?

"Vad nu?" means "what now?" in Swedish. The name reflects the core purpose of the system: organizing information to help you decide what action to take next.

## System Structure

Vadnu organizes information into a simple folder structure:

```
home
├── ARCHIVE
├── projects
├── ref
├── someday
└── TODO.md
```

- [/ARCHIVE/](/structure/archive) - Completed projects, references, &c that are no longer active
- [/projects/](/structure/projects) - Things that "can end" like work projects or meetings
- [/ref/](/structure/references) - Reference information you want to remember
- [/ref/p/](/structure/references-people) - Facts about people, promises made, and meeting notes
- [/someday/](/structure/someday) - Brainstorming and future project ideas
- [/TODO.md](/structure/todo) - Immediate tasks and action items
